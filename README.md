This hero will chose to enter a evil castle and fight 2-3 monsters where if he wins he is awarded points or souls, If he dies he loses all points and has to restart. There will be 2rounds of this at the end of each round he cam use these souls to increase health or attack. When you reach the end you get a little win sign and a choice to restart from the begninning.
